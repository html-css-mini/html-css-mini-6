      <h1>What is USD?</h1>
      <div class="usd1">Developed by Pixar, Universal Scene Description (USD) is the first open-source software that can robustly and scalably interchange 3D scenes that may be composed of many different assets, sources, and animations, while fostering highly collaborative workflows.</div>
      <div class="usd2">At Pixar, engineers work hand in hand with artists to create innovative technologies, tools, and pipelines that make our films. In this clip from Toy Story 4, millions of models, textures, lights, and colors are possible because of the power of USD architecture.</div>
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1qBW43jpgaw"><img class="image1" src="../img/image1.jpg" alt=""></a><hr>
      <a class="a1" href="#"><img class="image2" src="../img/image2.jpg" alt=""></a>
      
      <div class="usd3">The complex imagery seen in many Pixar films would not be possible without USD.</div>
      <h2>USD at Pixar</h2>
     <div class="usd4">USD is foundational to our work at Pixar– every character, every location, and every image of our films is built on top of USD and is made possible by the technology in USD.</div>
     <div class="usd5">Pixar is designing and deploying the next generation of features for USD and its imaging framework Hydra and, with the investment and support of The Walt Disney Company, increasing our collaboration on USD with the growing USD community, new industries, and partners. </div>
     <div class="usd6">Pixar has a long history of creating foundational and innovative technologies in computer graphics and beyond. We believe that USD has much to offer in the growing challenges of collaboration in 3D world-building and delivering assets at scale.</div><hr>
     <h3>The Alliance for OpenUSD</h3>
     <div class="usd7">In August 2023, Pixar announced the launch of the Alliance for OpenUSD (AOUSD), to promote the standardization, development, evolution, and growth of Pixar’s Universal Scene Description technology. Learn more about AOUSD <a href="https://aousd.org/" target="_blank">here</a>.</div><hr>
     <img class="image3" src="../img/image3.jpg" alt="">
     <h3>Opportunities in the metaverse</h3>
     <div class="usd8">Pixar envisioned USD to solve several workflow challenges and computer graphics complexity issues. </div>
     <div class="usd9">When we created USD, we weren’t thinking about the metaverse, but it just so happens that creating complex 3D worlds is an expertise that most companies don’t have. And it is a fundamental requirement for anyone building content or technology for the metaverse.</div>
